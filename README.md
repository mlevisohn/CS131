# CS131 Operating Systems 

## Maya Levisohn, Fall 2021

This assignment was to build a demo Unix shell as a concurrent program so that piped filter commands, like real Shell commands, could proceed
concurrently when possible. The assignment worked on new knowledge about threads in Java to make REPL loop
components execute in separate threads, thus enabling concurrency, and allow the commands to be executed in the background, like Unix shellâ€™s
background processes.
